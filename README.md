2) Introduction

Today, technology is advancing rapidly, and learning robotics and programming is becoming increasingly important, especially for young people who want to prepare for future careers. This project introduces an educational robot car, designed to help students learn easily. The robot uses Arduino and sensors to follow an object and stop at a distance of 5 cm. Through this project, young learners can explore basic concepts, such as using sensors and controlling motors, while developing their creativity. This will help them prepare for important fields like robotics and artificial intelligence.
